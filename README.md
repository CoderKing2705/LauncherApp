## Introduction

- I have developed a Launcher application using flutter technology that offers users a streamlined way to access and manage their installed applications. This launcher allows users to add their preferred applications to a custom launcher interface.
- One of the standout features of this launcher application is its ability to operate in Kiosk mode. This mode restricts the device to running only the specified applications, providing a focused and secure environment. 
- Importantly, this launcher application will be available into Tablets only (Android).


## Features

- The launcher allows users to effortlessly view and manage all installed applications on their system tablet.
- Users can add selected applications to the Kiosk Mode, ensuring that only designated apps are accessible.
- Provides a secure and controlled environment, ideal for educational settings, where restricted access to public applications is necessary.
